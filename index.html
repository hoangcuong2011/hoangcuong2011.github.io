<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>Hello! I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (Deep Learning Department) in California focusing on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Previously I worked as a Natural Language Processing at <a href="https://www.agolo.com/">Agolo</a> - a start-up that works on text summarization. I received my PhD at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a>.</p>

<p>Please connect me at <a href="http://github.com/hoangcuong2011">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoangcuong2011/">LinkedIn</a> or write an email to hoangcuong2011 [at] gmail.com.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Work experience and research interests</h2>

<p>I am particularly interested in the area of Natural Language Processing. My expertise is about to advance Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Some topics I worked on are Machine Translation, Text Classification, Knowledge Graph, Document Summarization. Recently my work is related in Speech synthesis as well.</p>

<p>I have experience in both academia (PhD + Postdoc) and industry (Researcher). I stayed in academia before where I worked on pure <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Upkae34AAAAJ&hl=en">research projects</a> in academia. Now my main work is to develop models and deploy them into production. While two different types of work could be different sometimes, I always try to keep the models I develop in production are the best (i.e. SOTA models) in the literature. Also I try to publish while working in industry as well.</p>

<p>I have a family with a little kid, thus I don't have much time for any hobbies. But I try to read as much as I can. Right now most things I read are technical but I hope I will have time to read more non-technical things in future.</p>
