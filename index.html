<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>Hello! I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (Deep Learning Department) in California focusing on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Previously I worked as a Natural Language Processing Scientist at <a href="https://www.agolo.com/">Agolo</a> - a start-up in New York that works on text summarization. I received my PhD at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a> in late 2017.</p>

<p>Please connect me at <a href="http://github.com/hoangcuong2011">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoangcuong2011/">LinkedIn</a> or write an email to hoangcuong2011 [at] gmail.com.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Work experience and research interests</h2>

<p>I am particularly interested in the area of Natural Language Processing. My expertise is about to advance Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Some topics I worked on are Machine Translation, Text Classification, Knowledge Graph and Document Summarization. Recently my work is related to Speech synthesis as well.</p>

<p>I have experience in both academia (PhD + Postdoc) and industry (Scientist). I stayed in academia before where I worked on pure research projects and publish <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Upkae34AAAAJ&hl=en">papers</a> on top conferences in the field (e.g. ACL, EMNLP, NAACL and COLING). Now my main work is to develop models and deploy them into production. While the types of work in these two enviroments are different sometimes, I always try to work with the best (i.e. SOTA) models in the literature for my work in industry. Also I try to publish papers.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I have a family with a little kid, thus I don't have much time for any hobbies. But I try to read as much as I can. Right now most things I read are technical but I hope I will have time to read more non-technical things in future.</p>
